This is a placeholder for the profile image.
Please replace this file with your actual photo named 'profile.jpg'

To add your photo:
1. Save your photo as 'profile.jpg' in the 'images' folder
2. Make sure it's a square image (same width and height) for best results
3. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
4. Upload the 'images' folder to your server via FileZilla

The CSS will automatically make it circular and responsive.
